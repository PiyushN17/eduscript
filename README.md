# 📘 EduScript — Exam‑Oriented Learning Platform

EduScript is a web‑based exam preparation platform designed to help university students **study smarter, write better answers, and perform confidently in exams**.  
Instead of focusing on generic learning or MCQs, EduScript focuses on **how universities actually evaluate answers** and how students can align their preparation accordingly.

🏆 **Winner — IIBM Campus Hackathon**  
EduScript was built and presented during the IIBM Campus Hackathon, where it secured **1st place** for its exam‑focused approach, structured data design, and practical feasibility.


## 🚀 Problem Statement

University students often face high stress and confusion during exam preparation due to:
- Scattered and unstructured resources (books, PDFs, videos)
- Lack of clarity on **important and high‑probability questions**
- No guidance on **how answers should be written**
- No real exam‑like practice before the final exam  

As a result, students study extensively but still struggle to score well.

EduScript is built around three carefully designed preparation modes, inspired by real student exam behavior:

### 📘 Study Mode
- Learn important exam‑oriented questions
- Gain concept clarity through structured answers
- Understand **what to write and how to write** in exams

### 🔁 Revision Mode
- Quiz‑based questions for quick recall
- Marks and feedback at the end
- Helps identify weak areas before exams

### ⏱ Exam Mode

## 🧾 Answer Optimization & Credibility

EduScript does not randomly generate answers.

We designed a structured **Answer Optimization Framework** based on:
- Analysis of **past 10 years PYQs**
- Identification of repeated and high‑probability questions
- Study of common university evaluation preferences

### Topper‑Inspired Refinement
- High‑scoring student answers were analyzed
- Common patterns identified:
  - Clear introductions
  - Point‑wise explanations
  - Balanced answer length
  - Logical flow
- These insights were used to refine all answers

⚠️ AI is used as an **assistant**, not an authority.

## 🏫 University‑Inspired Answer Pages

- Answer pages are designed **inspired by Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s answer‑writing style**
- Focus on:
  - Proper margins and spacing
  - Headings and sub‑headings
  - Point‑wise presentation
- Helps students visually understand **how answers should be written in the exam**

> Note: The design is inspired by university formats and is **not officially affiliated or approved**.
